## Description

This project revolves around creating a smart lamp system that enhances both convenience and energy efficiency. Utilizing the Raspberry Pi Pico W as its core, along with a motion sensor and a photoresistor, the lamp dynamically responds to its environment. By detecting motion, it ensures that illumination is provided when needed. Additionally, the led turns on/off based on ambient light levels, conserving energy when sufficient natural light is available and optimizing comfort when there is not enough light. This integration of motion and light sensing technology transforms the lamp into a versatile and adaptive lighting solution for any space.


## Motivation

I choose to persue this smart lamp project because I was thinking that one of the most important facilities of a smart house are the lights. This project tackles energy efficiency by innovating traditional lighting with a Raspberry Pi Pico W and motion/light sensors. It's a technical challenge that excites me, merging hardware and software seamlessly, so that I can craft a smart home solution that contributes to a mindful energy consumption.
